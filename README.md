This project is to evaluate the merits of different React UI Libraries.

I will be building a POC react app using different libraries.
I will be evaluating each library based on:
  Ease of use
  Size of compiled package
  Modularity and ability to include or uninclude code
  Styles of components

React UI Component Libraries to test:
  1. React Material-UI
  2. React Foundation
  3. React Bootstrap (Bootstrap 3: `react-bootstrap`)
  4. React Bootstrap (Bootstrap 4: `react-bootstrap@next`)
  5. React Toolbox?

Test
  - Buttons
  - Tabs
  - Icons
